# FILE-MANAGEMENT-TOOL

COMPANY NAME -CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME -AARYA DIPAK POUL

INTERN ID -CT08DK522

DOMAIN NAME -C++ PROGRAMMING

DURATION -8 WEEKS(APRIL 20th to JUNE 20th 2025)

MENTOR -NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

üìåOverview This is my first task , a C++ application to perform the operations like write ,read and append data on file.File is nothing but a storage system in c++ .This project is build to store data of student into the file .

The main purpose of this application is to store data into the file .The data is stored in text files which can be created ,appended and read .

Application allows user to :

1.Write new data to the file

2.Append new data to the file

3.To read existing datta in the file.

It is a desktop application and it uses standard libraries like iostream-for input /output operation ,fstream-for file handling (read/write/append) ,stdio.h,conio.h(for basic input/output and screen handling) etc.

üõ†Ô∏èRequirements to compile and run this application

To compile and run this project ,

1.IDE -Visual Studio Code (Or any IDE of your choice like Code::Blocks ,dev C++ etc)

2.A C++ Compiler (MinGW for windows or Code Runner extension in VS)

üíªHow it Works ??

Initially it shows a menu , which asks user to enter choice ,based on the choice of user :

1.Write -It checks if file exist or not ,if it exists then it writes the data that user has entered into the file .Otherwise gives messgae as "File not exist".

2.Append -It appends means adds data to the existing file .

3.Read - It simply reads the data previously entered by user .

At end it asks user ,if u want to exit then press 4.

üéØApplication Features The application provides simple text based menu to perform following operations .

1.write new data Allows user to write new data into the file .

2.Append new data Allows user to add new data into the existing file .

3.Read existing data Allows user to read the data that is alreday existed in file.

4.Exit Option Gives the user ability to exit from the menu gracefully after completing their operation .

üìöLearning Objectives

The primary learning objective of this project is to help beginners understand the fundamentals of file handling in C++. By building this application, learners will become familiar with how to use file streams to write, read, and append data. It also enhances knowledge of basic input/output operations, control structures, and working with text files. Additionally, this task strengthens problem-solving skills by requiring users to handle file existence checks and menu-driven interfaces. This small project also serves as a foundation for larger applications that involve data storage and retrieval, providing a hands-on introduction to real-world programming concepts.
